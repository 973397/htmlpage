                    schools which suffer from high rates of teacher absenteeism
                    may have encouraged the rapid growth of private (unaided)
                    schooling in India, particularly in urban areas. Private
                    schools divide into two types: recognized and unrecognized
                    schools. Government 'recognition' is an official stamp of
                    approval and for this, a private school is required to
                    fulfill a number of conditions, though hardly any private
                    schools that get 'recognition' actually fulfill all the
                    conditions of recognition.

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Up until 1976, education
                    policies and implementation were determined legally by each
                    of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the
                    constitution in 1976 made education a 'concurrent subject'.
                    From this point on the central and state governments shared
                    formal responsibility for funding and administration of
                    education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                    states and eight union territories, this means that the
                    potential for variations between states in the policies,
                    plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is
                    vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created
                    to guide states in their creation of state-level programs
                    and policies. State governments and local government bodies
                    manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and
                    the number of government-managed elementary schools is
                    growing. Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by
